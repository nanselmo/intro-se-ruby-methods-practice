# Ruby Methods Practice 1!

Welcome back! We're going to jump in to practicing building methods in Ruby. Remember that methods are chunks of code that we name and can call at any time. 

The synax for a method in Ruby is:

```ruby
def method_name(input)
  # code using the input variable
end
```

## Challenges

Follow the instructions in methods-examples.rb to build the following 6 methods.

* 1) Build a method `times_by_one_thousand` that takes an integer and multiplies it by 1000. (We started this one for you)

```
def times_by_one_thousand(number)
      #code here
    end
```

* 2) Build a method `how_old_will_i_be` that takes in your age (as an integer) and tells you how old you will be in the year 2030. (16 -> 30)

* 3) Build a method `make_excited` that takes a string, makes it all uppercase and adds three exclamation points. ("hello" -> "HELLO!!!")

* 4) Build a method called `happy_backwards` that takes in a string, reverses it, and then adds on a smiley face character at the end. ("cool" -> "looc :)")

* 5) Build a method called `is_even` that returns a boolean (true or false) depending on whether or not the number is divisible by 2. (3 -> false, 4 -> true)

* 6) Build a method called `grade_calculator` that takes in a number (0 to 100) and returns the letter grade that corresponds to it. (95 -> "A", 85 -> "B")
